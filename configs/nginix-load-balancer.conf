# Upstream block explanation:
# This block configures load balancing across multiple backend servers
# - Uses least_conn algorithm to distribute traffic based on active connections
# - Defines 3 backend servers with health monitoring (max 3 fails, 30s timeout)
# - Enables keepalive with 32 connections per worker process
# - Provides high availability and fault tolerance

# Server block explanation:
# This block defines the main NGINX server configuration
# - Listens on port 80 for all hostnames
# - Configures access and error logging with buffering
# - Sets up reverse proxy with header forwarding
# - Implements connection timeouts and response buffering
# - Provides a health check endpoint at /health
# - Optimizes for HTTP/1.1 with keepalive connections
